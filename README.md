## Motivation
I worked with Floors Like Glass to design & build a new website from scratch. They previously had a website that was outdated & needed to add info that had changed, along with wanting to add some new life and brightness to the overall design.

## Method & results
First, Floors Like Glass and I met to discuss the general design, direction and purpose of the site, which would later help me come up with mockups for the websites design. Second, based off the design, structure & purpose of the site I was confident in using React to built the site while hosting the site on Netlify. I knew React would deliver a clean and fast SPA, while Netlify would provide reliable & cost-effective hosting.
